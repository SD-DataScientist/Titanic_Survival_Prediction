# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
     This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the survival likelihood of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and family relationships.
     It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation to build an accurate predictive model.
     The goal is to analyze historical data from the Titanic disaster and develop a model that can predict which passengers were likely to survive.
