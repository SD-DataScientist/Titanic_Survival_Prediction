# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
     This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the survival likelihood of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and family relationships.
  ## Steps involved
          Data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.
     The goal is to analyze historical data from the Titanic disaster and develop a model that can predict which passengers were likely to survive.
