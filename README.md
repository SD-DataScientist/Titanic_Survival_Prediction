# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
     This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the survival likelihood of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various factors such as age, gender, ticket class, and family relationships.
  ## Steps involved
     Data preprocessing
     Exploratory data analysis (EDA),
     Feature engineering,
     Model selection
     Evaluation.
   ### Objectives
     The goal is to analyze historical data from the Titanic disaster and develop a model that can predict which passengers were likely to survive.
